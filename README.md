Basic drawing functions for Go

This library was started after [this](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/lXA_DHplrKo) conversation on the golang mailing list.  While the go standard libray has support for image manipuation, it lacks functions to draw basic shapes and lines.  The intent of this library is to provide those features, and provided there is enough support, merge them into the standard library.
