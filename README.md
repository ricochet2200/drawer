# Drawer
Basic drawing functions for Go

This library was started after [this](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/golang-nuts/lXA_DHplrKo) conversation on the golang mailing list.  While the go standard libray has support for image manipuation, it lacks functions to draw basic shapes and lines.  The intent of this library is to provide those features, and provided there is enough support, merge them into the standard library.

## How to use

Install this package in the normal way using `go get`.  Examples for how to use this library can be found in the [examples folder](https://github.com/ricochet2200/drawer/tree/master/examples).
